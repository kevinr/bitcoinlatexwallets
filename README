Unhappy with the state of bulk wallet generation, I wrote my own.

Requires Mako (http://www.makotemplates.org/),
Vanitygen (https://github.com/samr7/vanitygen), LaTeX, and 
the pst-barcode package (http://texdoc.net/texmf-dist/doc/generic/pst-barcode/pst-barcode-doc.pdf),
which is part of PSTricks.

Usage:

./gen-latex-wallets.py > out.tex
latex out.tex
dvipdf out.dvi
evince out.pdf

To clean up:

shred -u out.*
